Jest Testing
This package.json uses the "jest-expo" preset, but can use the "react-native"
preset if not using Expo.

Expo
The vector-icons is a massive icon library. This collection includes IonIcons
for iOS and MaterialIcons for Android.
The ex-navigation navigator can be a bit buggy and is supposed to be replaced
by react-navigation in the future. Ex-navigation is much easier to use
right away. React-navigation takes more time to setup, but seems to be more
customizable further down the road. React-navigation is still in beta and
has less online resources/pointers.
If using Expo, the react-native version must be the Expo SDK.

Store
This package.json has dependencies for Redux and Mobx. There aren't many online
resources for Mobx for React Native. Redux is the safer way to go, even though
it requires more setup at first.

Linting
ESLinting is used. The babel dependencies are required for these lintings. A
template .eslintrc file can be found in this project.

Useful NPM Modules

  after mapping through and array of Api calls.

  needed.

  when the view is large. This component works a bit better in certain cases.
